# Samuel Zulu — Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my projects, skills, and ongoing work as a Computer Science student at Concordia University.

The goal of this site is to provide a clean, minimal place where recruiters, collaborators, and peers can learn more about me and the work I’m doing.

## 🌐 Live Site

This site will be deployed using GitHub Pages once the initial layout is complete.
